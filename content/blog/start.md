After being delayed for a while, finally I had a google developer account in August 2015. In July, I started making my first application that I would upload to the store.
When I have an account, I can directly upload the APK. My first application is the Transjakarta Busway Navigator, an Android app to search for Transjakarta routes.

The idea of ​​this app came up because when I came to Jakarta, I completely have no knowledges about Jakarta, I needed this kind of app. Actually there is a similar app, but it is not satisfying and not simple.
I need simple ones, not complicated apps.
After 5 months (now December 2 2015), I have published 5 Android apps (2 games, 3 apps). 5 months = 5 apps, not bad for the project I was working on in spare time.

I did deliberately choose a project that can be done in a short time (at least for now). there is no idea to create complex games. to make games, really need
partner to realize it. especially in making game assets (game artists) and game design (game designers). 

Here's Transjakarta Busway Navigation App
